                        This week was not too bad, we are learning about matrices and how to translate, rotate and scale them. I am pretty familiar with matrices
                        especially manipulating them, such as adding and multiplying because I had taken discrete mathematics at CSUMB. This assignment was in the middle ground
                        of difficulty, I struggled with converting the math part to actual code, or code that is optimzed so I do not have to repeat it myself. For example
                        I struggled with the multiply function, because it makes sense if I were to write it out, however converting that equation to code was a bit tricky 
                        I found that it was easier to just write it all out or code it all out in this case.

                        <p>
                            What did surprise me was how the math directly translated to code, and when I am programming math equations and functions like this it 
                            becomes so much easier to understand as well. Especially with the help of the youtube videos, I feel as if I have a much better understanding
                            of new concepts when I can think of it as code, which is something I was not able to do before.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest challenge that my partner and I faced, was just removing repeated steps, such as multiply matrices together, we were not trying 
                            to do them by hand, so we tried many different kind of for loops and we were successful for some, and other we were not. What I had to keep looking
                            back to were the images of how to do matrix multiplication just to make sure I was doing the code correctly, and I had been making so many small errors
                            that I knew if I were to figure out how to put it into a for loop it would solve all the small errors I made.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All in all it was a great assignment, I feel that my partner and I were learning a lot through our struggles, and we worked great bouncing 
                            ideas off of each other.

                        This week was difficult, because we are taking what we have been learning and it was accumulated all into a single homework assignment,
                        which was incredibly interesting. I felt that all the background material that we have been learning was used purposefuly and I understand 
                        about 90% of what I was doing on the assignment, and the explanations were helpful as well. I was very excited while working on the homework
                        since it was visually changing with each line of code that I wrote.

                        <p>
                            A surprising thing about this assignment, is that since we had wrote a lot of the functions before hand, for the sphere, and vectors
                            it was a lot less difficult to try and piece it together. However getting it started was the hardest part, specifically figuring out pixelwidth,
                            I did not understand that part so I had to ask the teacher and his examples and live demonstration when viewing it made it a lot more clear to my 
                            partner and I. There was just very small details that can lead to a cascade of errors, which is how code naturally is. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest challenge I had faced had to fixing pixelwidth, and eye distance, these were foundational variables. I was struggling a lot
                            on trying to get the first vertical gradient, that basically made sure these foundational variables were correct, I had to do a lot testing to 
                            figure out that my pixel width was off, then after that my eye distance was the last thing I had figured out was wrong.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My partner and I were working well again like always. We were both struggling and scrambling to figure out what was wrong, and eventually
                            when we did figure out we were working things out pretty fast.

                        This week was a bit harder than last week, mainly because I was learning new material. We were introduced to rays, this week firstly in the form
                        that rays are another form of linear interporlation which I found extremely interesting, and the idea that many computer
                        generated letters are formed that way as well. I never had thought about how curves are generated on the computer but i guess I know now!

                        <p>
                           What was surprising to me was how we use the quadratic formula to calculate whether or not, and where, a ray intersects a circle.
                           I never used the quadratic equation or felt that it was really useful, and only used it in a very basic fashion, but 
                           using it this way is exciting for me, cause I am actually using mathmatical formulas for interesting things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest I challenge I had faced was figuring out how to calculate the coefficients for the discriminant, within 
                            the quadratic equation. I was confused on when to use dot product, for example on the ray orgin multiplied by the sphere 
                            origin. Another challenge that came along was finding out how to get find the "normal" or direction that the surface
                            was facing for the intersection, however when I visualized it and looked at example images it was pretty easy to understand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Again my partner and I were working well together, however we did both struggle, a lot! We both had to use a lot of
                            online external resources and resorting back to the slides and videos from class.

                        This week we went over vectors, and 
                        this brought back a lot of memories from highschool math. With vectors, I feel like every small detail is important since it is
                        such a foundational topic that plenty of other important programming 3d skills build on top of.
                        What I had to learn/refresh on was trigonometry, specially working with Sin, Cosine, Tangent, Etc. and how they are used when working with angles.
                        <p>
                            What was surprising/interesting was learning how some of these vector expressions are easier to understand
                            when I think about them as code uses such as for loops, something I was not able to do before.
                            Understanding that vectors can be placed anywhere in space, which is why it is a vector was trivial
                            yet new to me as well, because whenever we work with vectors it is always just plaecd on an axis, and I have not 
                            explored it too much outside of that, or in the real world, so I am excited to apply it to a real graphic program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest I challenge I had to overcome when working with vectors, was understanding the basic concepts again, such as 
                            scalers, and what a basis vectors work. Also learning how to calculate magnitude, direct and dot product. These all took a while
                            for me to learn again. In the programming assignment, after all the review it was not bad at all. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My partner and I worked very effectively, listening to each other and respecting each other ideas. We built on top of our ideas and contributed
                            properly, because of this we felt that we did not need to attend office hours. We were able to get through the A portion as well, I think what 
                            really helped is that we are both very familiar with javascript.
