                        This week we went over vectors, and 
                        this brought back a lot of memories from highschool math. With vectors, I feel like every small detail is important since it is
                        such a foundational topic that plenty of other important programming 3d skills build on top of.
                        What I had to learn/refresh on was trigonometry, specially working with Sin, Cosine, Tangent, Etc. and how they are used when working with angles.
                        <p>
                            What was surprising/interesting was learning how some of these vector expressions are easier to understand
                            when I think about them as code uses such as for loops, something I was not able to do before.
                            Understanding that vectors can be placed anywhere in space, which is why it is a vector was trivial
                            yet new to me as well, because whenever we work with vectors it is always just plaecd on an axis, and I have not 
                            explored it too much outside of that, or in the real world, so I am excited to apply it to a real graphic program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest I challenge I had to overcome when working with vectors, was understanding the basic concepts again, such as 
                            scalers, and what a basis vectors work. Also learning how to calculate magnitude, direct and dot product. These all took a while
                            for me to learn again. In the programming assignment, after all the review it was not bad at all.

                            My partner and I worked very effectively, listening to each other and respecting each other ideas. We built on top of our ideas and contributed
                            properly, because of this we felt that we did not need to attend office hours. We were able to get through the A portion as well, I think what 
                            really helped is that we are both very familiar with javascript.
